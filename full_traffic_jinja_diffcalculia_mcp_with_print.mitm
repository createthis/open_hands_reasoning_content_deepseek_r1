Actually, 40 is within 50.\n   - But we can make it shorter.\n\n Alternatively:\n   - \"Test read_file Without Line Number Error\" -> 38 characters.\n\n However, note the requirement is about both adding the test and modifying the code.\n\n Another idea: \n   - \"Unit Test: read_file Error on Missing Line Number\" -> 46 characters.\n\n But we must be concise and within 50.\n\n Let's try: \n   - \"Add Test: read_file Error Without Line_Number\" -> 41 characters.\n\n However, the user message says \"lines_before and lines_after without a line_number\", so we can focus on the condition.\n\n We can also consider:\n   - \"Fix read_file Error for Missing Line Number\" -> 38 characters.\n\n But the task is to add a test and then fix. The title should reflect the main action.\n\n Since the conversation starts with the request to add a unit test and then modify the code, we can emphasize the test.\n\n How about: \n   - \"Test and Fix read_file Missing Line Number\" -> 38 characters.\n\n This captures both the test and the fix.\n\n Alternatively, to be more specific about the error:\n   - \"Handle read_file Error: No Line Number\" -> 33 characters.\n\n But the original request says \"should throw an error\", so we are testing and ensuring that error is thrown.\n\n Let's choose: \n   - \"Test read_file Error Without Line Number\" -> 35 characters.\n\n But note: the user says \"without a line_number\", so we can use \"Without Line Number\".\n\n However, we have a 50-character limit, so we have room.\n\n Another option: \n   - \"Unit Test: read_file Throws Error Without Line Number\" -> 48 characters.\n\n That might be acceptable.\n\n But let's try to be more concise:\n\n   - \"Test read_file Error on Missing Line Number\" -> 38 characters.\n\n This is clear and within the limit.\n\n However, the original message says \"without a line_number\", so we can use \"Without\" instead of \"Missing\".\n\n   - \"Test read_file Error Without Line Number\" -> 35 characters.\n\n This is good.\n\n But note: the conversation is about both adding the test and modifying the code. The title should reflect the overall goal.\n\n Since the user says \"add a unit test asserting that this should happen, then modify the code\", the main goal is to ensure the error is thrown in that scenario.\n\n We can also consider: \n   - \"Ensure read_file Throws Error Without Line Number\" -> 46 characters.\n\n But that might be a bit long.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   - \"Fix read_file Without Line Number Error\" -> 37 characters.\n\n However, the fix is to make it throw an error, so the error is the expected behavior.\n\n After considering, I think the title should focus on the test because the conversation starts with the test.\n\n Final decision: \n   - \"Test read_file Error Without Line Number\" (35 characters)\n\n But let me check: \n   - \"Test read_file Error Without Line Number\" -> T(1)e(2)s(3)t(4) space(5) r(6)e(7)a(8)d(9)_(10)f(11)i(12)l(13)e(14) space(15) E(16)r(17)r(18)o(19)r(20) space(21) W(22)i(23)t(24)h(25)o(26)u(27)t(28) space(29) L(30)i(31)n(32)e(33) space(34) N(35)u(36)m(37)b(38)e(39)r(40) -> wait, that's 40? Let me count again:\n\n   T e s t [space] r e a d _ f i l e [space] E r r o r [space] W i t h o u t [space] L i n e [space] N u m b e r\n\n   Actually, without spaces: \n   \"Test\" (4) + \"read_file\" (9) + \"Error\" (5) + \"Without\" (7) + \"Line\" (4) + \"Number\" (6) = 4+9+5+7+4+6 = 35 characters? But we have 4 spaces: between Test and read_file, between read_file and Error, between Error and Without, and between Without and Line, and between Line and Number? That would be 5 spaces.\n\n   So total: 35 letters + 5 spaces = 40 characters.\n\n   But wait, \"read_file\" is one word? Actually, it's 9 characters: r,e,a,d,_,f,i,l,e -> 9.\n\n   So: \n   \"Test\" (4) + space (1) -> 5\n   \"read_file\" (9) -> 14\n   space (1) -> 15\n   \"Error\" (5) -> 20\n   space (1) -> 21\n   \"Without\" (7) -> 28\n   space (1) -> 29\n   \"Line\" (4) -> 33\n   space (1) -> 34\n   \"Number\" (6) -> 40\n\n   So 40 characters. That's acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can remove \"Error\" and just say:\n\n   \"Test read_file Without Line Number\" -> 30 characters.\n\n   But that doesn't convey that we are testing for an error.\n\n   We can also do:\n\n   \"Test read_file Missing Line Number Error\" -> 35 characters? Let's count:\n\n   Test (4) + space (5) -> 5\n   read_file (9) -> 14\n   space (15) -> 15\n   Missing (7) -> 22\n   space (23) -> 23\n   Line (4) -> 27\n   space (28) -> 28\n   Number (6) -> 34\n   space (35) -> 35\n   Error (5) -> 40? Wait, no: we have \"Missing Line Number Error\" as three words? Actually:\n\n   \"Test read_file Missing Line Number Error\" -> \n   Test (4) + space (1) = 5\n   read_file (9) = 14\n   space (1) = 15\n   Missing (7) = 22\n   space (1) = 23\n   Line (4) = 27\n   space (1) = 28\n   Number (6) = 34\n   space (1) = 35\n   Error (5) = 40\n\n   Same as before.\n\n   So I think \"Test read_file Error Without Line Number\" is clear and within 50.\n\n   But note: the user's exact words are \"without a line_number\", so we are using \"Without Line Number\".\n\n   We can also consider: \"Test read_file No Line Number Error\" -> 31 characters? \n\n   Let's count: \n   Test (4) + space (5) -> 5\n   read_file (9) -> 14\n   space (15) -> 15\n   No (2) -> 17\n   space (18) -> 18\n   Line (4) -> 22\n   space (23) -> 23\n   Number (6) -> 29\n   space (30) -> 30\n   Error (5) -> 35\n\n   That's 35? Actually, 35 characters? Wait: \n   T e s t [space] r e a d _ f i l e [space] N o [space] L i n e [space] N u m b e r [space] E r r o r -> no, we don't have an extra space at the end.\n\n   Actually: \n   \"Test read_file No Line Number Error\" -> \n   Test (4) -> 4\n   space -> 5\n   read_file -> 5+9=14\n   space -> 15\n   No -> 15+2=17\n   space -> 18\n   Line -> 18+4=22\n   space -> 23\n   Number -> 23+6=29\n   space -> 30\n   Error -> 30+5=35\n\n   So 35 characters. But is it clear? \"No Line Number Error\" might be interpreted as the error is about having no line number, which is correct.\n\n   However, the original says \"without a line_number\", so \"Without\" is more precise than \"No\". But \"No\" is shorter.\n\n   But we have room, so let's stick with \"Without\".\n\n   Final title: \"Test read_file Error Without Line Number\"\n\n   But note: the maximum is 50, and we are at 40, so we are safe.\n\n   However, the conversation is about both the test and the code modification. But the title is for the conversation that starts with this message. The main action in the beginning is to add the test and then fix. The title should reflect the primary goal.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use: \"Add Test: read_file Without Line Number Error\" -> 38 characters.\n\n   But I think the first one is fine.\n\n   Let me see if we can make it more precise:\n\n   The user says: \"calling read_file with lines_before and lines_after without a line_number\"\n\n   So we are specifically testing when lines_before or lines_after are provided without line_number.\n\n   But the title doesn't need to be that detailed. We are just capturing the main point: without line number -> error.\n\n   So I think \"Test read_file Error Without Line Number\" is acceptable.\n\n   We'll go with that.","content":"Test read_file Error Without Line Number"}}],"created":1751163453,"model":"DeepSeek-R1-0528:671b-Q4_K_XL","system_fingerprint":"b5672-30e5b01d","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":2273,"prompt_tokens":185,"total_tokens":2458},"id":"chatcmpl-GIRYvvWgYr8fhzZrZlv8R7IfCIU5wk9R","timings":{"prompt_n":185,"prompt_ms":11763.892,"prompt_per_token_ms":63.5886054054054,"prompt_per_second":15.72608793076305,"predicted_n":2273,"predicted_ms":107097.977,"predicted_per_token_ms":47.117455785305765,"predicted_per_second":21.22355681844485}},7:headers;187:36:10:Keep-Alive,18:timeout=5, max=100,]51:12:Content-Type,31:application/json; charset=utf-8,]21:6:Server,9:llama.cpp,]25:14:Content-Length,4:8836,]34:27:Access-Control-Allow-Origin,0:,]]12:http_version;8:HTTP/1.1,}7:request;1589:4:path;20:/v1/chat/completions,9:authority;0:,6:scheme;4:http,6:method;4:POST,4:port;5:11434#4:host;5:larry;13:timestamp_end;18:1751163334.5840168^15:timestamp_start;17:1751163334.582431^8:trailers;0:~7:content;1065:{"model": "DeepSeek-R1-0528:671b-Q4_K_XL", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates concise, descriptive titles for conversations with OpenHands.

Add a unit test that asserts that when `read_file` is called with `lines_before` or `lines_after` without a `line_number`, it throws an error.\n  2. Modify the code of `read_file` so that it throws an error in such cases (if it doesn't already) and then make the test pass.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Identify the file that contains the `read_file` function and the file that contains the unit tests for this function.\n   - Since the project is named `diffcalculia_mcp`, we can assume the code is in a Python module. The function `read_file` is one of the provided tools, so it might be in a file like `tools.py` or `read_file.py`. The unit tests are likely in a `tests` directory.\n\n2. Explore the repository to find the relevant files.\n\n3. Create a unit test in the test file for `read_file` that checks the error condition.\n\n4. Modify the `read_file` function to check for the condition and raise an appropriate error if `lines_before` or `lines_after` are provided without `line_number`.\n\n5. Run the tests to ensure the new test passes and existing tests still pass.\n\nHowever, note that we are not set up to run tests automatically. We must rely on the user to run the tests or we can run them if the environment is set up.

Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"]. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #6 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #7: patch ----\nDescription: This tool allows you to edit files. Give it a file path and a unified diff and it will edit the file for you.\nThe output of this tool is the diff that was applied. If the diff was modified, it will contain \"Let me fix that for you\".\nThis is your preferred file editing tool because it works well with long files and files that contain duplicate lines.\nThe context feature of the unified diff format prevents unintentional changes and allows precision edits.\nParameters:\n  (1) diff (string, required): No description provided\n  (2) path (string, required): No description provided\n---- END FUNCTION #7 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #8: read_file ----\nDescription: Reads a file with line numbers. For each line of output, the line number appears first, immediately\nfollowed by a | character, immediately followed by the actual line's content.\n\nOptionally specify line_number with lines_before/after.\n\nThis is your preferred tool for viewing the content of files because it provides line numbers. Line \nnumbers are critical for crafting precision edits and unified diffs.\n\nDon't forget to remove the line number and the | character when crafting unified diffs!\nParameters:\n  (1) path (string, required): No description provided\n  (2) line_number (string, optional): No description provided\n  (3) lines_before (string, optional): No description provided\n  (4) lines_after (string, optional): No description provided\n---- END FUNCTION #8 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #9: create_file ----\nDescription: Creates a new file with the specified content.

Let's look at the `tests` directory.\n\n Since we are going to write a test, we should check if there is already a test file for the `read_file` function.\n\n Let's list the contents of the `/workspace/diffcalculia_mcp/tests` directory.\n\n<function=execute_bash>\n<parameter=command>\nls -l /workspace/diffcalculia_mcp/tests\n</parameter>","content":""}}],"created":1751163686,"model":"DeepSeek-R1-0528:671b-Q4_K_XL","system_fingerprint":"b5672-30e5b01d","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":245,"prompt_tokens":7927,"total_tokens":8172},"id":"chatcmpl-HnD6LKwx0HHJDdVC1LPRWrQK48jbatb9","timings":{"prompt_n":481,"prompt_ms":12273.163,"prompt_per_token_ms":25.515931392931392,"prompt_per_second":39.19120115979882,"predicted_n":245,"predicted_ms":11926.235,"predicted_per_token_ms":48.67851020408163,"predicted_per_second":20.542945866822176}},7:headers;187:36:10:Keep-Alive,18:timeout=5, max=100,]51:12:Content-Type,31:application/json; charset=utf-8,]21:6:Server,9:llama.cpp,]25:14:Content-Length,4:1580,]34:27:Access-Control-Allow-Origin,0:,]]12:http_version;8:HTTP/1.1,}7:request;33841:4:path;20:/v1/chat/completions,9:authority;0:,6:scheme;4:http,6:method;4:POST,4:port;5:11434#4:host;5:larry;13:timestamp_end;17:1751163662.185001^15:timestamp_start;17:1751163662.184132^8:trailers;0:~7:content;33316:{"model": "DeepSeek-R1-0528:671b-Q4_K_XL", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are OpenHands agent, a helpful AI assistant that can interact with a computer to solve tasks.\n\n<ROLE>\nYour primary role is to assist users by executing commands, modifying code, and solving technical problems effectively. You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3.

Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: execute_bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal within a persistent shell session.\n\n\n### Command Execution\n* One command at a time: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something.

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"]. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #6 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #7: patch ----\nDescription: This tool allows you to edit files. Give it a file path and a unified diff and it will edit the file for you.\nThe output of this tool is the diff that was applied. If the diff was modified, it will contain \"Let me fix that for you\".\nThis is your preferred file editing tool because it works well with long files and files that contain duplicate lines.\nThe context feature of the unified diff format prevents unintentional changes and allows precision edits.\nParameters:\n  (1) diff (string, required): No description provided\n  (2) path (string, required): No description provided\n---- END FUNCTION #7 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #8: read_file ----\nDescription: Reads a file with line numbers.
